Welcome to cnmodel's documentation!
===================================


CNModel is a model of the cochlear nucleus built with the goal of replicating
the membrane properties, synaptic kinetics, network connectivity, and 
physiological response properties described in the last several decades of
literature.

It is based on the NEURON simulation environment and expands on the auditory
periphery model published by Zilany et al. (2014).
