<img style="float: right; padding: 3px 3px 0px 3px;"src="images/LillianBrooxManisObitPhoto1.jpg" alt="Lilli Manis" width="400" ><p>This site was Lilli's, given as a present on her 15th birthday*. She wanted to use it to post her art and writing, and was redesigning the site when she was tragically killed in a car crash. Her brother, Cameron, and her father, Paul, continue to  fill this site with her work, and are using some of the templates that she was creating. The site includes poetry, writing, drawings, digital art, and pictures of her life. It is occasionally updated as new material is discovered or becomes available. Most recent site update: the August 2011 (scholarship, some pictures).<br />
<p>Lilli was accepted to, and planned to go to <a href="http://www.earlham.edu">Earlham College</a>, in Richmond Indiana. Earlham is a small, independent, private college, established by Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). In honor of her plans and interest in Asian studies and art, we have established the the &ldquo;<i>Lillian Broox Manis Scholarship Fund</i>&rdquo;, at Earlham to  remember her life, her interests, and her goals. The Fund will be used to help support students at Earlham, for example to enable study for a semester or a year abroad, or for specific experiences in Art or Asian Studies. <font color=#CDBFAC>This fund has reached the <i>endowed</i> level as of late 2009, and we have begun awarding the scholarship, starting in 2010!</font><br />
<p>Donations may be made to the &ldquo;Lillian Broox Manis Scholarship Fund&rdquo;, at Earlham College, <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/campaign/">Alumni and Development Office</a>, 801 National Road West, Richmond, Indiana, 47374, tel (765) 983-1313, or by using <a href="https://secure.acceptiva.com/?cst=4403e8">Earlham's on-line form </a> (specify gift as "Other", and put &ldquo;Lillian Broox Manis Scholarship Fund&rdquo; in the comments box).  Donations are tax-deductible, and may be eligible for matching funds by your employer.  <br  />

</div>    <hr><div id="footnote">* The site name derives from the initials of a character that Lilli was developing 
for a manga series. The goal was to resurrect the character. Our original suggestion that it was related to hx.resurrection or helix resurrection appears to have been incorrect. (Corrected 9/14/08, thanks to Cameron).
